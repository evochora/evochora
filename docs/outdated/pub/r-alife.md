# [Open Source] I built a distributed lab in Java 21 to research the physics of Open-Ended Evolution. Now I'm looking for collaborators.

**The Mission**: I am building Evochora, a laboratory designed to investigate the hurdles towards Open-Ended Evolution (OEE). Landmark systems like Tierra or Avida were milestones, but the field hasn't yet cracked the code for creating truly unbounded complexity. My goal is to provide a rigorous platform to study exactly why digital evolution gets stuck and to test solutions (like thermodynamics, signaling, and multi-threaded agents) that might help us progress.

> This is not another a-life game or script; this project aims to contribute to real scientific breakthroughs!

**The Hypothesis**: Existing systems often rely on "disembodied" logic, artificial CPU quotas, or predefined goals to maintain stability. Evochora is built to test the hypothesis that emergent complexity arises from embodiment and physics, not administrative rules.

To back this up, the core foundation is already built and running:
-   A **multi-phase compiler** that translates a custom assembly language (evoASM) into code that organisms execute within their n-dimensional world.
-   A **lightning-fast VM** designed from the ground up for true n-dimensional embodiment.
-   A **decoupled data pipeline** architected for massive horizontal scaling in the cloud.
-   **Analytics and visualizer** web frontends to inspect everything from a single organism's actions to a "galaxy-wide" overview.

Installation is easy: [Download and start](https://github.com/evochora/evochora/blob/main/README.md#quick-start-run-a-simulation)

## The Current Challenge: "Grey Goo"

This is still an early stage, but the foundation is ready: a viable, self-replicating organism exists. However, without artificial constraints, the system currently behaves like a raw physical medium, tending towards a "Grey Goo" scenario. Damaged organisms fall into tight, aggressive "Zombie" loops that indiscriminately overwrite the shared memory space.

This is, of course, the expected first barrier and is rather easy to overcome. But we must not fall into the trap of prioritizing short-term population stability by sacrificing long-term evolvability! Instead of introducing fixed concepts that punish zombie behavior, we are now looking to solve this by implementing Thermodynamics, as every life form is basically an entropy machine (E. Schrödinger).

## Call for Collaboration

I am looking for collaborators who are thrilled about pushing scientific ALife beyond its current frontiers. The engine is stable, the compiler is mature, and the data pipeline (Protobuf/Reactive) is ready for cloud scaling.

I need help on all frontiers; here are a few examples:
-   **ALife Physics**: Designing thermodynamic laws to stabilize the Grey Goo.
-   **ALife Physics**: Developing improved territorial concepts to defend space.
-   **ALife Physics**: Using fuzzy jumps as a foundation to introduce inter-organism signaling.
-   **Experiments**: Creating new primordial designs that spawn additional execution contexts to become multi-threaded.
-   **Engineering**: Optimizing the VM loop for even larger grids.
-   **Engineering**: Helping to scale the data pipeline for the massive amount of data produced.
-   **Engineering**: Extending the existing visualizer and analyzer web frontends or providing a new frontend to manage the data pipeline.

**And there are many more opportunities to engage with!**
