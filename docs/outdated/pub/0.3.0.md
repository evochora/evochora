This is an important release that achieves long-term stable populations for the first time. This was made possible by new thermodynamic rules, a better territory ownership model, and an improved organism replication process that respects these new "physics". The release also includes improvements to the Visualizer and Analyzer web frontends, as well as a faster and more efficient persistence layer.


## Key Features

### Thermodynamic Policies & Entropy
In addition to the previously existing energy handling, there are now also entropy constraints. Organism actions can generate entropy that organisms need to deal with. The accumulation of too much entropy leads to the death of an organism. 
To make this possible, organisms now have an additional entropy register (SR) next to the energy register (ER). 
Thermodynamics is configurable with fine-grained policies in the central evochora.conf, depending on the used instruction, the read or written molecule, and the ownership state of a read molecule. 

### Clean territory ownership model
There is now a clean territory ownership model that ensures that organisms can hand over the generated code during a replication to their offspring. This is made possible by the new Molecule Marker Register (MR). Once set to a value different from zero, all molecules generated by an organism will get this marker. When the offspring is released with the FORK instruction, the MR is also used: All molecules that have the same marker will be set as owned by the new offspring. 
This replaces the previous handling, where no ownership transfer happened, but instead offspring organisms were implicitly allowed to pass through molecules owned by their parent, which is not allowed anymore.
The new SMR instruction allows the organism to set its MR.

### Stable population
With the use of the new territory ownership model and the new thermodynamic policies the replication logic of the primordial organism was updated in a way, that the population is now much more stable. With previous releases populations finally always ended in "grey goo" where no organisms replicated anymore due to degenerated genomes. Now we see populations that survive longer than one million ticks and show a much higher amount of healthy individuals.

## Additional improvements

* Web Analyzer: Added Auto-LOD for Parquet. The analytics endpoint for Parquet files now supports automatic Level-of-Detail (LOD), improving calculation performance.
* Web Visualizer: The Visualizer web frontend was extended to show Marker Register (MR) and Entropy Register (SR) as well as entropy generation during instruction execution.
* Organism persistence storage: A new SingleBlobOrgStrategy improves performance and saves storage space by storing organism states as binary blobs.
* Memory Optimizations: Optimized queue capacities and batch sizes across the data pipeline to reduce heap usage.
